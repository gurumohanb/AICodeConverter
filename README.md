How AI Adds Value in Migration

Automated Code Translation

AI models and deterministic tools convert VB.NET to C# efficiently while preserving semantics.

Machine learning assists where deterministic conversion fails (complex constructs, implicit types, legacy API mappings).

Contextual Refactoring

LLMs analyze converted code to apply idiomatic C# patterns (async/await, LINQ, nullable types) and recommend design improvements.

Automated Validation & Testing

Pre- and post-conversion test execution ensures migrated code retains original behavior.

AI-driven differential analysis highlights potential logic or regression risks.

Smart Project Orchestration

AI agents coordinate migration per project, handle build/test pipelines, and generate reports with migration quality scores.

Human-in-the-loop Governance

Engineers focus only on flagged high-risk areas while the agent handles 80–90% of repetitive transformation work.
