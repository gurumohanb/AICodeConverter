How AI Adds Value in Migration

**Automated Code Translation**

AI models and deterministic tools convert VB.NET to C# efficiently while preserving semantics.

Machine learning assists where deterministic conversion fails (complex constructs, implicit types, legacy API mappings).

**Contextual Refactoring**

LLMs analyze converted code to apply idiomatic C# patterns (async/await, LINQ, nullable types) and recommend design improvements.

**Automated Validation & Testing**

Pre- and post-conversion test execution ensures migrated code retains original behavior.

AI-driven differential analysis highlights potential logic or regression risks.

**Smart Project Orchestration**

AI agents coordinate migration per project, handle build/test pipelines, and generate reports with migration quality scores.

**Human-in-the-loop Governance**

Engineers focus only on flagged high-risk areas while the agent handles 80–90% of repetitive transformation work.

**C# console application that:**

Recursively reads a solution directory.

Identifies .vbproj and .vb files.

Uses the popular ICSharpCode.CodeConverter
 package to convert VB.NET code to C#.

Outputs the converted code into a new solution structure under a Migrated root folder, preserving the original structure.
